## Home Automation Roadmap

This document captures our **concrete, technical plans** for how the home automation system should evolve. It is intended to describe specific target states and design decisions, not just ideas or open questions.

### Near-term

This section will focus on planned improvements to the existing networking and heating systems, including configuration changes, hardware upgrades, and integration work.

### Mid-term

This section will cover adding new subsystems such as lighting, sensors, alarms, and other components that extend the current setup.

### Long-term

This section will capture more ambitious or experimental ideas for the home automation system that are not yet scheduled but are worth tracking.
