## Home Automation Documentation

This repository is the central, technical documentation for our home automation setup. The goal is to clearly describe **what we currently have** and **what we are aiming to achieve**, with concrete decisions instead of open-ended questions.

For now, the focus is on:

- **Networking**: How devices connect, communicate, and access external services.
- **Heating**: How we control heating, zones, schedules, and integration with automation.

Over time, this documentation will expand to cover:

- **Lighting**
- **Sensors**
- **Alarms**
- **Other subsystems** that become part of the home automation ecosystem.

This repository is meant to be a **single source of truth** that evolves alongside the actual system.
